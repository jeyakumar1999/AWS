Â the virtual hub (MyVHub) is in a different resource group (Hub-Resource-Group) than the virtual network (MyVNet), which is in VNet-Resource-Group. explain


When an Azure virtual hub is in one resource group and a virtual network is in another, you're dealing with a cross-resource group virtual network peering. This is a common setup for large organizations with separate teams managing different parts of the infrastructure. The key is to use the full resource ID of the virtual network when you connect it to the virtual hub, ensuring that Azure can locate and connect the resources across the different resource groups.

How It Works
Virtual Hub: The central point of connectivity for your virtual network. It's the core of your Azure Virtual WAN.

Virtual Network: The network where your virtual machines and other resources reside.

Resource ID: This is the unique identifier for a resource in Azure. It includes the subscription, resource group, and resource name. When resources are in different resource groups, the resource ID is the only way to accurately reference them.

Azure CLI Example
To connect a virtual network to a virtual hub when they are in different resource groups, you use the az network vhub connection create command, but you must first retrieve the VNet's resource ID.

Get the VNet's Resource ID: This command queries the virtual network and stores its unique ID in a variable.

Bash

vnetId=$(az network vnet show \
  --resource-group "VNet-Resource-Group" \
  --name "MyVNet" \
  --query id --output tsv)
Create the Connection: This command uses the stored vnetId to create the peering. The virtual hub is identified by its resource group (Hub-Resource-Group) and name (MyVHub), while the virtual network is identified by its full resource ID.

Bash

az network vhub connection create \
  --resource-group "Hub-Resource-Group" \
  --vhub-name "MyVHub" \
  --name "MyCrossGroupConnection" \
  --remote-vnet "$vnetId"
This process allows you to connect the two resources even though they are managed in separate resource groups, enabling centralized network management while maintaining separate administrative domains.

The error message `InvalidArgumentValue: --remote-vnet: Invalid format: resource id should be in '/subscriptions/{subscription}/resourceGroups/{resource_group}/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/{}' format` means that the value you provided for the `--remote-vnet` parameter is not a properly formatted **Azure Resource ID**.

### Solution

The solution is to ensure that the value you pass to the `--remote-vnet` parameter is the complete, correct resource ID of the virtual network. The format must include the subscription ID, resource group name, and virtual network name, as shown in the error message.

### How to Get the Correct Resource ID

The safest way to get the correct resource ID is to use the `az network vnet show` command and query for the `id` property. This avoids typos and ensures the format is correct.

Here's the step-by-step process:

1.  **Get the virtual network's resource ID**: Replace `<VNet-Resource-Group>` and `<MyVNet>` with your actual resource group and VNet names.

    ```bash
    vnetId=$(az network vnet show \
      --resource-group "<VNet-Resource-Group>" \
      --name "<MyVNet>" \
      --query id --output tsv)
    ```

2.  **Use the variable in your command**: Now, use the `$vnetId` variable in your `vhub connection create` command.

    ```bash
    az network vhub connection create \
      --resource-group "Hub-Resource-Group" \
      --vhub-name "MyVHub" \
      --name "MyConnection" \
      --remote-vnet "$vnetId"
    ```

This two-step process ensures you are always using a valid resource ID, which will prevent the `InvalidArgumentValue` error.
